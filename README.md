# SmartHouse

Welcome to SmartHouse! This is my super cool, totally serious, and definitely professional pet project where I pretend to know how to automate a house. Itâ€™s like having a really bad but enthusiastic intern for your home. ðŸ˜Ž

## What Is This?

SmartHouse is a project that does... things. Smart things. For your house. Imagine lights that turn on when you clap, coffee that brews itself, or a door that refuses to open because itâ€™s in a bad mood. Well, none of that is here yet, but weâ€™re dreaming big!

## Features (Or Lack Thereof)

- Lights ON/OFF: Control your lights... sometimes. If the code works.
- Temperature Monitoring: Tells you it's cold. Or hot. Or nothing at all if the sensor breaks.

## Why Did I Build This?

Because I can. And because smart houses sound fun until they start spying on you. This one only spies on itself. Maybe.

## How To Use This Mess

Clone the repo: git clone https://github.com/anatolyduzenko/SmartHouse.git

// To-do: Fill this part

Pretend you live in the future. ðŸ¤–

## Tech Stack

Languages: JavaScript, maybe Python, who knows?

Frameworks: Probably none, but if I got ambitious, maybe Vue or React?

Hardware: Your computer, a Raspberry Pi (if I feel fancy), and a lot of duct tape.

## Future Goals

- Make it do _actual_ smart house stuff.
- Add voice control so it can ignore you like a real family member.
- Build a robotic cat that judges you.

## Contributing

Want to help? Great! Just don't break it more than it already is. Submit a PR or open an issue if you're feeling brave.

## Disclaimer

This project is for fun. Don't actually trust it with anything important. Seriously, don't.

Enjoy living on the edge with SmartHouse! ðŸ˜„
